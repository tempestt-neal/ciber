# Open positions

We are looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

You will have the chance to work in the growing field of natural language processing: its use for the study of language, its interface with computer reasoning, and its application in analyzing human behaviors both within and beyond the field of computer science. 

### Applications for PhD positions
If you are interested in working with Dr. Kim as a PhD student, please send him an [email](mailto:genekim@usf.edu) and submit an application to the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at USF. In your email, state briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. **Important**: please insert _"Application PhD"_ in the subject line so that I don't miss it.
