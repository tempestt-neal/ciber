### Undergraduate Researchers
We are always looking for enthusiastic undergraduate students interested in gaining hands-on experience in research. Ideal students will have some experience in our research areas and will be able to clearly articulate how they want to contribute to the lab. Ideal students will also be able to dedicate 3-5 hours to working with our research team per week, and will meet regularly during lab meetings. All undergraduate students are brought into the lab as volunteers, and are encouraged to take full advantage of the wide spectrum of learning opportunities. *Importantly, all undergraduates working with the lab should strongly considering registering for Supervised Research (CIS 4915) credits.*

### M.S. students seeking a thesis advisor are encouraged to reach out to Dr. Neal no later than the middle of their first semester in the M.S. program.
