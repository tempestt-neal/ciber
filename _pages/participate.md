# Participate in Our Research 

## Age-Aware User Authentication

We are seeking a limited number of research participants between the ages of 6-12 and 18+ years old.
  
**Study Purpose:** The purpose of this study is to investigate age-aware user authentication methods in home settings. User authentication is important > for protecting you against unauthorized use of your personal computing devices, such as laptops and smartphones. It is likely that you already use an authentication method like a password or face recognition. However, these methods are not easily usable for users of different age groups. For example, younger users may find it difficult to create strong passwords. This study aims to collect data to help us develop new user authentication techniques that support users of all ages.

**Your Role in this Study:** If you are interested, you will be asked to participate in four sessions with us. The first session is completely virtual via Microsoft Teams where a member of the research team will overview the consent form which details the study procedures and allows you to make an informed decision on if you want to participate. This meeting is approximately 20 minutes. 
You can then decide if you would like to participate in the following three sessions, which will require you to come into the lab on three separate occasions for data collection. Each of these sessions will last for approximately one hour, where you will perform a set of everyday tasks like watching short YouTube videos and typing on a computer. As you complete these tasks, the research team has developed software to collect various types of data characterizing your interaction with the devices you will be using, including but not limited to, video, audio, physiological data (e.g., heartbeat), keystroke, and touchscreen gestures. 

You will be compensated $35 as an e-gift card for each completed session. As a participant, you must be willing to agree to comply with all COVID-19 safety measures as outlined in the consent form.

**Do you qualify?** If you are 6 to 12 or 18 years old or older and wish to participate, please [click here](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/CIBeRBookings@usfedu.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/s/bvjubQkJaE-l3S0hDXNrUg2) to select a time to schedule your first session where we will overview the study details. Once you’ve selected a date and time that works for you, 
a researcher will reach out to you to formally schedule the meeting.

## Dementia and AI

CIBeR Ph.D. student, Wilson Lozano, is seeking caregivers of individual’s diagnosed with dementia to participate in a 45-minute interview. The interview aims to gather information about behavioral and social cues of distress in patients with dementia, with a long-term goal of gathering these cues in an automated fashion using non-intrusive sensors and artificial intelligence. The goal is to design and build a smart agent for at-home use to assist caregivers in monitoring their loved ones, with a specific goal in predicting and detecting distress in the patient. With this, we hope to improve the quality of life of both patients and caregivers by allowing caregivers to responding proactively to distress rather than reactively. Our interviews focus on which items to consider when developing such a tool, and if and how such a tool might be useful to caregivers (and what we should not implement in its development).
 
If you are the primary caregiver of a person with dementia, and are at least 18 years old, we’d love to schedule a 15-minute virtual meeting with you to overview this study’s design. Please send an email to wilsonlozano@usf.edu if you are interested to schedule this initial 15-minute meeting. After the call, if you would like to participate, we will schedule your interview (either in-person or virtually). The interview will be recorded; however, we will discard any identifying information associated with your participation. After the interview, you will be compensated $15 as an e-gift card as a thank you for your time.
