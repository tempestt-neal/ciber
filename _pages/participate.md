# Participate in Our Research 

## Age-Aware User Authentication

We are seeking a limited number of research participants between the ages of 6-12 and 18+ years old.
  
**Study Purpose:** The purpose of this study is to investigate age-aware user authentication methods in home settings. User authentication is important > for protecting you against unauthorized use of your personal computing devices, such as laptops and smartphones. It is likely that you already use an authentication method like a password or face recognition. However, these methods are not easily usable for users of different age groups. For example, younger users may find it difficult to create strong passwords. This study aims to collect data to help us develop new user authentication techniques that support users of all ages.

**Your Role in this Study:** If you are interested, you will be asked to participate in four sessions with us. The first session is completely virtual (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Zoom, etc.), where a member of the research team will overview the consent form which details the study procedures and allows you to make an informed decision on if you want to participate. This meeting is approximately 20 minutes. 
You can then decide if you would like to participate in the following three sessions, which will require you to come into the lab on three separate occasions for data collection. Each of these sessions will last for approximately one hour, where you will perform a set of everyday tasks like watching short YouTube videos and typing on a computer. As you complete these tasks, the research team has developed software to collect various types of data characterizing your interaction with the devices you will be using, including but not limited to, video, audio, physiological data (e.g., heartbeat), keystroke, and touchscreen gestures. 

You will be compensated $35 as an e-gift card for each completed session. As a participant, you must be willing to agree to comply with all COVID-19 safety measures as outlined in the consent form.

**Do you qualify?** If you are 6 to 12 or 18 years old or older and wish to participate, please [click here](https://www.picktime.com/ciber) to select a time to schedule your first session where we will overview the study details. Once youâ€™ve selected a date and time that works for you, 
a researcher will reach out to you to formally schedule the meeting.
