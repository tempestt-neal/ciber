  description: Over the past decade, analyses of biometric recognition for infant and toddler identification have emerged. These efforts are critical since existing child identification programs are solely utilized in missing children cases; such programs are not employed in the wider spectrum of societal issues that child identification efforts could help to resolve, such as baby swapping in hospitals, illegal adoption, and inadequate vaccination tracking. As such, this paper provides a brief literature review on biometric recognition for infants and toddlers. We cover the range of potential applications for biometric identification of infant and toddler-aged children, along with current research findings, especially those involving fingerprint recognition due to the permanence of fingerprint features and the practicality of implementing fingerprint recognition systems for younger children. In addition, we investigate the acceptability of biometric technologies for infants and toddlers by conducting an online survey (N = 133), wherein we gather the opinions of adults on the utility of biometric systems for young children, how these systems might help solve societal issues, and problems users may face if such a system were available. Key results show that while over half of respondents are comfortable with a biometric system for infants and toddlers, and parents in particular are more likely to view biometric recognition useful for helping to resolve societal issues than non-parents, data storage, privacy, and the child's inability to provide consent on their own are common concerns.

  image: stylometry_survey.png
  description: This paper explores the habits of people when posting on several topics on social media platforms. We recruited 160 college-level students to participate in an online survey. Our survey asked respondents to indicate their likelihood to post on seven topics, as well as indicate why they may be hesitant to post on these topics. Self-identity, politics, health and mental health, finance and business, and science and technology emerged as sensitive topics which give rise to some level of self-censorship. Many respondents reported various reasons explaining their hesitation, including fear of negative responses or that a friend or family member might see the post. We also observed several differences between men and women respondents, especially on the topics of education and health. Our efforts could inform future research on the Spiral of Silence theory as it provides new topic-based evidence on selective posting habits.

- title: "Authenticating Phone Users Using a Gait-Based Histogram Approach on Mobile App Sessions"
  image: stylometry_survey.png
  description: Collectively, user-friendly interfaces, small but impactful sensing technologies, intuitive device designs, and the variety of mobile applications (or apps) have transformed the expectations for cellular phones. Apps are a primary factor in device functionality; they allow users to quickly carry out tasks directly on their device. This paper leverages mobile apps for continuous authentication of mobile device users. We borrow from a gait-based approach by continuously extracting n-bin histograms from numerically encoded app data. Since more active subjects will generate more data, it would be trivial to distinguish between these subjects and others which are not as active. Thus, we divided a dataset of 19 months of app data from 181 subjects into three datasets to determine if minimally active, moderately active, or very active subjects were more challenging to authenticate. Using the absolute distance between two histograms, our approach yielded a worst-case EER of 0.188 and a best-case EER of 0.036 with a worst-case initial training period of 1.06 hours. We also show a positive correlation between user activity level and performance, and template size and performance. Our method is characterized by minimal training samples and a context-independent evaluation, addressing important factors which are known to affect the practicality of continuous authentication systems.
